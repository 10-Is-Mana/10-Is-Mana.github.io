      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, this is Mana. The simplest way to introduce myself: language lover. I like reading books, so far I tried reading books in Japanese, English and French. 
        I can sing in Brazilian Portuguese and Drenjongke. Last but not least, I can code in Python and Javascript. 
        I guess I like playing with any kinds of symbols. Symbols ususally have some rules when interacting with each other. 
        These rules may be related to syntactic restrictions (you cannot write "dogs" when there's only one), 
        references (you cannot refer a symbol without ever mentioning it before the time you are referring it) or,
        they may be the rhyme of poems and the harmony of songs. They have their own way of establishing their rules. Isn't it inspiring?
      </p>
